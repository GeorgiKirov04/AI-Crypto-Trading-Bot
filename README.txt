Starting The Bot:
To start using the Trading Bot, follow the steps outlined below:

Step 1: Folder Setup
When you download all the folders, you must open the folder called: "Final_Bot_Binance". 

There you will find the following files: 
"btctusd_bot.py", "rewriting_the_code.py", "credits.py" and "requierements.txt"

# Step 2: API Configuration
Locate the file named credits.py in the folder and open it.
Add your API and API secret keys to the designated fields in the file. These keys are required to connect to the trading platform and execute trades. Make sure to obtain valid keys from Binance.
Save and close the credits.py file.

# Step 3: Installation
Open the terminal or command prompt in your development environment.

Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
--- IF YOU GET ERRORS AFTER INSTALLING "requirements.txt" ---
1 - pip install --upgrade pip
2 - pip install python-binance
3 - pip install ccxt
4 - pip install pandas
5 - pip install numpy
6 - pip install websocket_client

Step 4: Starting the Application
Depending on your trading preference, open one of the following files:

For paper trading (simulated trading with no real money), open rewriting_the_code.py.
For real trading with actual funds, open btctusd_bot.py.
Before running the chosen file, ensure you have completed Step 2 and configured the API keys in the credits.py file.

Run the selected file. You can use the following command:
python rewriting_the_code.py or python btctusd.py
or just press Ctrl + f5

The program will now start, and a message stating "Connection opened" will appear in the console.
The bot will continuously monitor the market and execute trades when the predefined criteria are met.

Customization
Symbol
By default, the Trading Bot is set to trade with the BTC/TUSD symbol.
If you wish to change the trading symbol, you can modify it within the code of the selected file (rewriting_the_code.py or btctusdt_bot.py).

Time Frame
The Trading Bot operates on a specific time frame, which determines the duration of 
each candlestick used for analysis. You have the option to customize the time frame based on your trading strategy. 
To do this, modify the corresponding parameter within the code of the selected file.
